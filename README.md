# Solutions of the problem sets in ud810 

This repository contains implementation of low-level and mid-level vision algorithms from scratch tailored to the requirements of the problem sets.
The description of each folder is as follows:
## 1. PS0 => Images as Functions
 - Basic Image Processing using OpenCV

## 2. PS1 => Edges and Lines
 - Hough Transform: Lines and Circles

## 3. PS2 => Window-Based Stereo Matching
 - Stereo Geometry and Depth of Image

## 4. PS3 => Geometry
 - Camera Calibration
 - Epipolar Lines

## 5. PS4 => Harris, SIFT, RANSAC
 - Harris Corners
 - Feature Detection using SIFT
 - Removing outliers using RANSAC

## 6. PS5 => Optical Flow
 - Basic Lucas Kanade
 - Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids
 - Warping by flow
 - Hierarchical LK Optic Flow
